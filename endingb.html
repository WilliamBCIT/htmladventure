    <h1>Blueberry Neighbourhood</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos and Bluebettsy worked together to complete a program to distract Java from the distraction.</p>
        <p>Giant text characters fell from the sky, threating to crush Java...</p>
        <p>But they didn't... Instead, they were converted to MIX format.</p>
        <p>Incorrectly, that is... "THAT'S ALL WRONG! THE ENCODED FORM CAN NOT BE GGGGG!" Java roared.</p>
        <p>Samit and Vlad ran off from Java's attack, and Avocarlos and Bluebettsy made it back to campus.</p>
        <p>Bluebettsy submit her assignment, and then turned to face Avocarlos.</p>
        <p>"Thanks so much Avocarlos. I have to tell you something. I am the secret leader of Set B! Don't worry, I'll cheer them all up, so they can fight back against Java's evil plots.</p>
        <p>"Just remember one thing, Avocarlos. You won't have to face Java alone."</p>
