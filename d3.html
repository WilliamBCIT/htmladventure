    <h1>Durian Hall - Official Office</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos started quickly reading through the pages on the podium in front of him, as John and Durianne continued to argue.</p>
        <p>How strange... Something in the papers in front of him seemed familar.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos recoiled upon viewing it more closely. It was Java code! Yikes.</p>
        <p>Despite his horror, Avocarlos decided to continue looking at the paper. Yes, it was Java, yet something seemed different about it.</p>
        <p>He absorbed the entire document, enchanted by the meaning of it.</p>
        <pre>public class Dreams
        {
            public static void main (String[] args)
            {
                System.out.println ("Hi.");
                System.out.println ("Hi.");
                System.out.println ("Hi.");
                System.out.println ("Hi.");
            }
        }</pre>
        <p>Avocarlos couldn't decipher who composed the program, since there were no comments mentioning the author.</p>
        <p>Another biting retort from Durianne</p>
