    <h1>The Library Staircase</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos and Sirtet approached the staircase leading up to the second floor of the library.</p>
        <p>It was clear that Java was lying in wait for the ultimate battle.</p>
        <p>However, they would be not unsupported. Avocarlos, upon hearing footsteps, turned around to glimpse sight of some of his newest friends.</p>
        <p>Bluebettsy, Calvelope, Durianne, and Elderberty had gathered behind him.</p>
        <p>"I wasn't kidding when I said you wouldn't have to face Java alone." Bluebettsy said with a faint smile.</p>
