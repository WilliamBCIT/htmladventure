    <h1>The Story of Avocarlos</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos quickly scaled the stairs at the front of the BCIT library, as Sirtet magically floated inside after him.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos was happy to see the library was open, but he didn't see a single student he could recognize from the CST program.</p>
        <p>"I must conclude there is an important lecture for the CST students at this time, Avocarlos." Sirtet explained as the Avocado looked around the broad entranceway.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos still seemed a little gloomy, so Sirtet continued to talk:</p>
        <p>"I guess you must be wondering where I came from, right?"</p>
        <p>Avocarlos turned to face Sirtet. Despite concern for the CST students being bored by the troublemaker Java, he was curious to learn more about his new hovering cuboid pal.</p>
        <p>"I was destined to fill the gap in a line of Tetris, which Kiaan was playing during one lecture in the past."</p>
        <p>"Yet Kiaan had to stop playing so he could finish a Java lab, and my destiny was ruined..."</p>
        <p>"That's why we have to help the students here! So Java won't overtake their entire life!"</p>
        <p>Avocarlos appreciated the bravery of Sirtet, and thus decided to continue with the quest.</p>
