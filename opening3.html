    <h1>The Story of Avocarlos</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos sat down at an empty table, and Sirtet continued to float beside him.</p>
        <p>It was a nice window seat, yet Avocarlos still felt concerted for the whereabouts of the CST students.</p>
        <p>Yet a friend was near, after all. "Good morning, Avocarlos!" Jenelle cheerfully spoke.</p>
        <p>A CST student! Avocarlos was overjoyed.</p>
        <p>Before long, she was caught up with the situation at hand.</p>
        <p>"Wait, why are you even out of lecture?" Sirtet mentioned to Jenelle with a hint of accusation.</p>
        <p>"It's...not that important..." Jenelle replied, rather nonplussed.</p>
        <p>"Oh." Sirtet mumbled. "Do you think there's any signs of Java's influence right now? Like, before everyone went to lecture?"</p>
        <p>"Well, I think the other four sets seemed really upset earlier. It must be their labs." Jenelle explained.</p>
        <p>"So we must find the other four sets, help them, and gain the power to defeat Java!" Sirtet finally concluded.</p>
        <p>"Good luck with that. I'm heading out to get some coffee..." Jenelle made her exit.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos beamed with excitement! He was ready to rise up against the ominous forces surrounding his friends.</p>
        <p>"I think I know where we must head. Being a programmed object from a video game, I should be able to sense the presence of those who require our help.</p>
