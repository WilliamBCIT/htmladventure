    <h1>Cantelope Labs - Glass Tunnel</h1>
        <p>Uh oh. Avocarlos and Sirtet were LOST. The Cantelope Labs in the school were surrounded by an extensive glass hallway, one that was a little difficult to naviagate.</p>
        <p>No matter how far they would walk, they would end up passing by the same doorways and staircases without fail.</p>
        <p>Worse yet, these landmarks were not useful in locating anyone who needed help from Avocarlos. They were simply more dead ends.</p>
        <p>"We're going to walk in circles forever..." Sirtet moaned.</p>
        <p>The blocky character floated to the ground in exhaustion, much to Avocarlos' dismay. How could Sirtet possibly complain about walking when he could float everywhere and anywhere?</p>
        <p>Avocarlos did have worry building up inside himself, however. Java could be up to no shortage of diabolical plots involving sinister mutators and unexpected accessors.</p>
        <p>Night had fallen, and all Avocarlos could see in the glass was his perplexed reflection.</p>
