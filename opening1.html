    <h1>Avocarlos Arrives</h1>
        <p>As a cool winter breeze lingered in the air, Avocarlos stepped off the bus taking him to BCIT.</p>
        <p>The grand building in front of Avocarlos served as entrance to the rest of campus, glass panels glistening many colours in the faint sunlight.</p>
        <p>He walked past this, and continued through the sprawling world in front of him until he reached the heart of the school, and the library was in sight.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos reflected upon his goal: To free the students of BCIT from the clutches of Java.</p>
        <p>Something pulled him out of his thoughts, however. Something in the grassy fields bordering the parking lots tugged at his attention, yet he could not determine why.</p>
