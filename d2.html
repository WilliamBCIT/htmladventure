    <h1>Durian Hall - Lecture Room</h1>
        <p>Durianne is even more angry now! The nerve of playing video games at university. Unforgiveable!</p>
        <p>Avocarlos was chased all the way into the lecture room by her!</p>
        <p>Durianne continued to complain. "That does it! Say I'm the best student in the entire program!"</p>
        <p>"No! Best in the entire school! No! BEST IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!"</p>
        <p>She still seemed very aggravated. What could possibly be done now?</p>
        <p>Thankfully, Avocarlos would soon have a little luck. John walked into the room.</p>
        <p>"Wait... this isn't Relational Database Systems? Oh @#$!"</p>
        <p>Durianne stiffened with pride. "Yet another lesser student." She mocked.</p>
        <p>John was taken aback. "Now let me tell you-"</p>
        <p>Durianne interrupted! "No, I think-"</p>
        <p>"Well I think-" John countered.</p>
        <p>"Actually, the truth is-" Durianne didn't give up.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos sneaked away from the two, Durianne and John, whose battle of wits would likely continue for some time.</p>
        <p>Sirtet directed his friend to behind the podium, where Avocarlos tried to understand the recent turn of events.</p>
        <p>It would be no good if Durianne kept focused on the highest GPA and getting the last word in with any argument...</p>
        <p>She would have to learn to cooperate if she would be able to help Avocarlos stop the tyranny of Java.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos needed a plan, undoubtedly. His eyes lingered on the large stack of papers in front of him.</p>
