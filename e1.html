    <h1>Elderberry Path - Endless Woods</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos is happy he filled his backpack with snacks to spare. The forested path he chose to walk down is one that stretches forward for a very significant length. </p>
        <p>Abruptly, a CST student passes Avocarlos, walking down the trail at twice the pace.</p>
        <p>Sirtet screams aloud! "ARE YOU MAD?! IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE IN THESE WOODS!"</p>
        <p>Rhys, the beanie clad student, shrugs without much emotion.</p>
        <p>"It's not that dangerous...", he mutters.</p>
        <p>Sirtet only becomes more animated. "THE FOOL! AVOCARLOS! RHYS IS A FOOL!"</p>
        <p>Avocarlos tried to calm Sirtet down as Rhys' expressions become more twisted and confused.</p>
        <p>"RHYS! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! JAVA IS OUT TO GET US! IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL AND QUIET, JAVA WILL FIND US!"</p>
        <p>Before Rhys can make some kind of witty reply, Java, had tumbled out of a tree. The coffee was still clad in freaky mask and cape.</p>
        <p>"LOOK WHAT YOU DID RHYS!" Sirtet shrieks as Java snatches the puzzle block pal!</p>
        <p>Yikes! Poor Sirtet has been encapsulated in one of Java's ominous methods!</p>
        <h3>Sirtet is totally out of Avocarlos' party...</h3>
        <p>"Heh heh heh." Java darkly chuckles. "First, Elderberty of Set E, now I have captured Sirtet! Avocarlos' trusty companion! Good luck escaping these woods.</p>
        <p>Rhys blinked, attempting to restore comprehension to his life.</p>
        <p>"I guess we're walking the same way, right?" Rhys finally spoke.</p>
        <h3>Rhys joined Avocarlos' party!</h3>
        <p>Rhys made his first action as a party member! "...So, uh, what do we do?"</p>
