    <h1>Blueberry Neighbourhood - Clear Park</h1>
        <p>With the power of stickers, Avocarlos captured pieces of the scenery around him. The images swirled around him, glowing, before eventually flying into Bluebettsy's laptop!</p>
        <p>"The pictures, they're all there! Thank you so much! My name is Bluebettsy, by the way."</p>
        <p>"I'm Avocarlos! No problem, for the help."</p>
        <p>Bluebettsy smiled. "Thanks! Let's get back to campus, quickly. Say, aren't you the mascot for Set A of CST?"</p>
        <p>As the walked back down the sidewalk, Avocarlos humbly shrugged. "I suppose so."</p>
        <p>Before the conversation could continue, a wicked laugh shattered the calm air.</p>
        <p>"MWA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!"</p>
        <p>There Java stood, with a fearsome cape and demented mask. "Sorry, Bluebettsy, but I can't have you making Set B happy anytime soon. Give me your laptop!"</p>
        <p>"No way!" Bluebettsy yelled, as Avocarlos stepped forward. Both looked determined to stop their foe.</p>
