    <h1>Blueberry Neighbourhood - Refreshing Path</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos left the university campus, and was happy to have discovered the wonderful scenery surrounding the area.</p>
        <p>Before long, he encountered someone else. A short, round, yet cheerful fruit sat on a bench working on their own laptop.</p>
        <p>However, her happiness did not last terribly long. Suddenly, she turned pale. "I forgot the images for my webpage!" she gasped aloud.</p>
        <p>"My assignment is almost due! How could I possibly find them in time?!"</p>
        <p>Avocarlos blinked, and it came to him. This must be another student from BCIT.</p>
        <p>She needed help, quickly. Avocarlos looked around. There was beautiful scenery all around the pair.</p>
        <p>"Excuse me." Avocarlos politely said. "What do you need  for your project?"</p>
        <p>"Images for a project on the neighbourhood around campus, ironically! There just isn't enough time to take my own pictures or head back to campus to download some."</p>
        <p>"In fact, in a few minutes I'll have to head back to submit this for partial marks..." She said with a heavy sigh.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos just had to do something.</p>
        <p></p>
