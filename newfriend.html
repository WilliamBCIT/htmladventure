    <h1>Avocarlos meets Sirtet</h1>
        <p>Avocarlos walked past the concrete landing of the library, and instead walked into a nearby field.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, there was a small blue block on the ground, inexplicably in the center of the grassy landscape.</p>
        <p>Curious, Avocarlos approached it.</p>
        <p>"Why, hello there!", the small block on the ground cheerfully exclaimed.</p>
        <p>Avocarlos was obviously taken aback by this. After all, everyone knows Avocados can talk, but not square blocks!</p>
        <p>"Oh! I suppose you're surpised to see me.", the block added after Avocarlos had fallen to the ground in surprise.</p>
        <p>"My name is Sirtet! By chance, do you happen to know Kiaan?"</p>
        <p>Avocarlos cheerfully nodded. Kiaan was the artist responsible for the creation of Avocarlos, of course.</p>
        <p>"So, you know the vile Java has captured all of his free time, and endangered the mere concept of fun!"</p>
        <p>Avocarlos grimmly nodded. The reason he had begun his new quest was his concern at Kiaan and his many friends starting a second term at BCIT.</p>
        <p>Java's ultimate scheme is to make that experience somewhat less fun. How Awful!</p>
        <p>"I Sirtet, will help you in your quest, Avocarlos! Let's head to the school library, and I will explain the plan to rescue the world from Java!"</p>
        <h3>Sirtet joined Avocarlos' party!</h3>
