    <h1>Elderberry Path - C's Trap</h1>
        <p>Rhys and Avocarlos were pretty proud of themselves for trying some computer skills.</p>
        <p>"Yo! Java! You're really dumb!" Rhys cockily snapped out towards an innocent clump of flowers.</p>
        <p>"Yo! Rhys! You're even dumber!" The flowers yelled back.</p>
        <p>Wait? The flowers yelled back! What?!</p>
        <p>"Thanks to me!" An unknown voice shot out, which also was a rather scary voice.</p>
        <p>"W-w-w-who's that?" Rhys said in wavering form.</p>  
        <p>"Hello! Haven't met me yet, have you? I am C!"</p>
        <p>"To be frank, I'll be around a lot for your second term of CST."</p>
        <p>"I'll be helping Java carry out his plans."</p>
        <p>"What does that have to do with talking flowers?" Rhys, sarcasm returning, sputtered out.</p>
        <p>"Everything, as you'll soon find out!" C flashed a sinister smile. "Now my flower army! Show these two the pain and power of procedual pollen!"</p>
        <p>The flowers began spraying clouds of pollen in the air without remorse. Rhys and Avocarlos stumbled around in the confusion, being unable to do much of anything.</p>
